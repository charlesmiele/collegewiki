Trying to plan out this college wiki MVP. Just seeing if it could work.
I want to display the data from the database.

Looking at the database:

The thing is, I need to attribute every attribution of data to someone. To see their contributions.  This may mean some re-desiging.

Okay, so let's say we're rendering the page of a school. What data will need to be rendered?

Going from top to bottom

-If the person is signed in, their profile. This could be put as template page
-The name of the school
-Admissions data(1 table)
-Financial aid data(another table)
-Anectodes(A grid of links)
-Anectode upvote count

MVP rules: NO CSS ALLOWED!

The way I look at it, many of the nitty-gritty details should be hidden away from the average user. You can look into it if you want. Like inspecting element.
